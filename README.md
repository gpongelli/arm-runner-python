# ARM-Runner images with compiled Python


ARM-Runner images from RaspiOS repo `https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/` rebuilt to contain 
compiled Python into `/opt/build_python/installed` folder.

Made to be used with [arm-runner-action](https://github.com/pguyot/arm-runner-action) when building Python C-extension project, 
to avoid compile python each time.
